## tszm-react

Eventually it had to happen: The React-based Web (or Native) frontend for TSZM.

## Roadmap

- Dual-display web app: xterm.js terminal display with full z3+ cursor positioning support, as well as a window showing png output from zmcdn
- React Native port for iOS/Android/Samsung refrigerator
- Potential to start the audiotext version from here

## Status

12-Oct-2025 - Just getting started. Expect nothing.

Currently tszm is imported as a submodule, not via npm. This is intentional and it'll stay this way unless and until we decide tszm should go into npm.
